# Apps

> A collection of add-on apps that can easily fit into Omniport

Omniport is designed to simplify app installation to the point of simply adding
said app to an `apps` folder. This is that `apps` folder.

Drop your omniport-compliant apps into this folder and watch them get recognised
by your setup automatically.
