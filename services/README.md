# Services

> A collection of core services that Omniport apps rely on for various utilities

Omniport ensures that code is structured in the best way possible and grouping 
services into their own folder is the right way to organise code.

Note that the services in the `services` folder are not drop-in like the apps 
in the `apps` folder.
