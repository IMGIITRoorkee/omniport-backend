# Branding

Every portal deserves its own branding. Omniport supports easy branding of the portal to customise it for your institute.

## Instructions

The following files are required to brand Omniport with your custom branding.
- `institute_logo.png`
- `maintainers_logo.png`

Since Omniport allows you to run multiple sites (such as Intranet and Internet) from the same portal, we allow you to brand them separately by loading indexed files like this. This is optional and you can skip the parenthesised portion to use the same asset across your sites.
- `site_favicon(_<site_id>).ico`
- `site_logo(_<site_id>).png`
