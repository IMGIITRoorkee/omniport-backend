# Core

> A collection of the core functionality that makes Omniport what it is

Omniport keeps various typically disjoint functionality separated as separate 
packages grouped under `core`. This is that `core`.

Note that the `core` is not to be altered in any way, unlike `services` which 
are cloned separately and `apps` which are discovered automatically.
