> The backend of the one true portal for any and every educational institute

## Backend

Omniport is a portal for educational institutes, designed from the ground up to
be extensible, customizable, performant and powerful. Omniport also comes with 
a powerful collection of apps and is simple enough for you to be able to write
your own.

## Technological stack

- Framework: `Django`
- Language: `Python`
- Reverse proxy: `NGINX`
- WSGI server: `Gunicorn`
- ASGI server: `Daphne`
- Database: `PostgreSQL`
- Cache: `Memcached`
- In-memory store: `Redis`

A Dockerised setup is the preferred mode of installation. One such is provided 
by us on our GitHub account. You can however set all the components up yourself, 
after suffering a reasonable amount of headbanging, cursing, and physical and 
mental pain.
