Hello IMG,

Sub - Need my account migrated in newchanneli.

I am 2013 batch student, was not able to complete my no-dues during my time there.
Had to leave for a job due to financial reasons at the time.
I have never been able to come back to roorkee due to professional limitations.
However, I need my degree for my future endeavours.

Recently, I learnt that I can file my nodues through newchanneli.
However, I am not able to login. It says my account does not exist.
But I am able to login on old channeli.

I've tried contacting the offices and academic section. But no one picks up the phone.
Please consider my hopeful attempt by raising a PR.

> The backend of the one true portal for any and every educational institute

## Backend

This is the backend of Omniport.

## Technological stack

- Language: `Python`
- Framework: `Django`
- API Framework: `Django REST framework`
- Server: `Gunicorn + Daphne`
- WS Routing: `Channels`
- Other noteworthy packages: `Django OAuth Toolkit`, `Swapper` 

A Dockerised setup is the preferred mode of installation. One such is provided 
by us on our GitHub account. You can however set all the components up yourself, 
after suffering a reasonable amount of headbanging, cursing, and physical and 
mental pain.

This can be found at `https://github.com/IMGIITRoorkee/omniport-docker`.
