> The backend of the one true portal for any and every educational institute

## Backend

This is the backend of Omniport.

## Technological stack

- Language: `Python`
- Framework: `Django`
- API Framework: `Django REST framework`
- Server: `Gunicorn + Daphne`
- WS Routing: `Channels`
- Other noteworthy packages: `Django OAuth Toolkit`, `Swapper` 

A Dockerised setup is the preferred mode of installation. One such is provided 
by us on our GitHub account. You can however set all the components up yourself, 
after suffering a reasonable amount of headbanging, cursing, and physical and 
mental pain.

This can be found at `https://github.com/IMGIITRoorkee/omniport-docker`.
