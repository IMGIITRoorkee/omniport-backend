# Core

> A collection of the core functionality that makes Omniport what it is

Omniport keeps various critically essential but typically disjoint functionality 
separated as separate packages. This is that collection, `core`.

Note that the `core` is not to be altered in any way, unlike apps which 
and services which are discovered and configured based on your setup.
