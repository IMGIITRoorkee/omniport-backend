# Services

> A collection of services that Omniport apps rely on for various utilities

Omniport has a set of applications that apps depend on for some functionality.
These services must be placed in this folder, `services/`.

Services are not plug-and-play like apps, and therefore all services must be 
cloned in order to ensure that everything works as expected.
